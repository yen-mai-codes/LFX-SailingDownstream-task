# LFX-SailingDownstream-task
Submissions for Coding challenge for my [Sailing Downstream](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/ef07a2bd-8ec6-4b7e-bcc0-3de191e01ff3) application.

### Problem Description
I'm picking the second option from the coding challenge:

Write a Javascript, Python, or OCaml program that:
* accepts a list of integers
* emits an error message if the list is not a multiple of 10 in length
* returns or prints a list of integers based on the input list, but with items at positions which are a multiple of 2 or 3 removed

Host your program at a public git-based repository and include robust testing for your program.
